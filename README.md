# Production-oriented Snow Water Equivalent Forecasting Workflow

## Project Goal

This project aims to develop a robust and scalable workflow for predicting software engineering outcomes in the context of the western United States. This project leverages machine learning and geospatial analysis techniques to address the unique challenges and characteristics of software development in this region.

We basically have the barebone workflow up and running, but the machine learning models and some steps need a lot of work to get it function correctly and up to our expection. Please refer to the `Key Problems to Solve` section to get more details about the issues that are puzzling right now.

Some preliminary results and machine learning models are obviously underestimating most time.
